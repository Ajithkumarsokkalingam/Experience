As a Software Developer Intern at Afame Technologies, I have been actively involved in developing innovative solutions in the travel and transportation sector. My key projects include:

1. Online Reservation System
I developed an Online Reservation System that streamlines the process of booking and managing reservations. This system is designed with user-friendliness in mind, allowing users to easily log in, book, and cancel reservations. The system efficiently manages and stores data in a central database, accessible only to authorized personnel. My work focused on ensuring the application is intuitive, secure, and reliable, contributing to a seamless user experience.

2. Railway Reservation System
Leveraging my skills in Java and GUI design, I built a comprehensive Railway Reservation System that operates outside the console, offering a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive user experience. This system facilitates smooth ticket bookings and cancellations, improving the overall efficiency of railway reservations. Working on this project enhanced my abilities in Java programming, software design, and user interface development, and allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in a real-world setting.
